## About
  
Tinyne is a small desktop application for working with simple notes. With this application, you can instantly create primitive notes that will be safely stored on your computer. Pin Tinyne to your home screen, using *OnTopMost* button so that it is always at your hand.  
  
  
  
## Setup

You can **[download](https://github.com/1khtiyar/Tinyne/releases/tag/v1.0.0)** the latest installable version of Tinyne for Windows only.  
If the installer was listed as malware, don't worry, the reason for this notification is that there is no signed certificate that I am currently working on.
